Git is an open source version control system 

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. 
Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collection of information.

Github is the website to hold your repositories online.


git branch (to check which branch we are in)
git checkout -b feature (creates a new branch with the name feature)
git checkout main (back to the main branch)

git diff branchName

git push (gives instruction on what to do when pushing)
git push -u origin feature 

A pull request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project.

--> To see changes in the code (after the PR is merged)
	git pull origin main
	
git branch -d feature

git commit -am fileName (add and commit together if a file has been already created that file shows as modified )

If you make changes to a feature file (branch) and there are changes to the same file of main branch
then you cannot switch to the main branch if you don't commit first

git merge main
merge conflict

Undoing in github
